searchIndex['customsearch1'] = {"items":[[0,"","customsearch1","This documentation was generated from *customsearch* crate version *0.0.1*.\nThe original source code can be found [on github](https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs/tree/master/gen/customsearch1).\n# Features\n \nHandle the following *Resources* with ease from the central [hub](struct.Customsearch.html) ... \n \n* cse ([*list*](struct.CseListMethodBuilder.html))\n \nEverything else about the *customsearch* *v1* API can be found at the\n[official documentation site](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest).\n \nNot what you are looking for ? Find all other google APIs in their Rust [documentation index](../index.html).\n \n# Structure of this Library\n \nThe API is structured into the following primary items:\n \n* **[Hub](struct.Customsearch.html)**\n    * a central object to maintain state and allow accessing all *Activities*\n* **[Resources](cmn/trait.Resource.html)**\n    * primary types that you can apply *Activities* to\n    * a collection of properties and *Parts*\n    * **[Parts](cmn/trait.Part.html)**\n        * a collection of properties\n        * never directly used in *Activities*\n* **[Activities](cmn/trait.MethodBuilder.html)**\n    * operations to apply to *Resources*\n \nGenerally speaking, you can invoke *Activities* like this:\n \n```Rust,ignore\nlet r = hub.resource().activity(...).doit()\n```\n \nOr specifically ...\n \n```ignore\nlet r = hub.cse().list(...).doit()\n```\n \nThe `resource()` and `activity(...)` calls create [builders][builder-pattern]. The second one dealing with `Activities` \nsupports various methods to configure the impending operation (not shown here). It is made such that all required arguments have to be \nspecified right away (i.e. `(...)`), whereas all optional ones can be [build up][builder-pattern] as desired.\nThe `doit()` method performs the actual communication with the server and returns the respective result.\n \n# Usage\n \n## Setting up your Project\n \nTo use this library, you would put the following lines into your `Cargo.toml` file:\n \n```toml\n[dependencies]\ncustomsearch1 = \"0.0.1\"\n```\n \n## A complete example\n \n```test_harness,no_run\nextern crate hyper;\nextern crate \"yup-oauth2\" as oauth2;\nextern crate \"rustc-serialize\" as rustc_serialize;\nextern crate customsearch1;\nuse customsearch1::cmn::Result;\n# #[test] fn egal() {\nuse std::default::Default;\nuse oauth2::{Authenticator, DefaultAuthenticatorDelegate, ApplicationSecret, MemoryStorage};\nuse customsearch1::Customsearch;\n \n// Get an ApplicationSecret instance by some means. It contains the `client_id` and \n// `client_secret`, among other things.\nlet secret: ApplicationSecret = Default::default();\n// Instantiate the authenticator. It will choose a suitable authentication flow for you, \n// unless you replace  `None` with the desired Flow.\n// Provide your own `AuthenticatorDelegate` to adjust the way it operates and get feedback about \n// what's going on. You probably want to bring in your own `TokenStorage` to persist tokens and\n// retrieve them from storage.\nlet auth = Authenticator::new(&secret, DefaultAuthenticatorDelegate,\n                              hyper::Client::new(),\n                              <MemoryStorage as Default>::default(), None);\nlet mut hub = Customsearch::new(hyper::Client::new(), auth);\n// You can configure optional parameters by calling the respective setters at will, and\n// execute the final call using `doit()`.\n// Values shown here are possibly random and not representative !\nlet result = hub.cse().list(\"q\")\n             .start(26)\n             .sort(\"erat\")\n             .site_search_filter(\"sadipscing\")\n             .site_search(\"dolor\")\n             .search_type(\"eirmod\")\n             .safe(\"elitr\")\n             .rights(\"amet\")\n             .related_site(\"no\")\n             .or_terms(\"labore\")\n             .num(62)\n             .lr(\"dolore\")\n             .low_range(\"invidunt\")\n             .link_site(\"aliquyam\")\n             .img_type(\"accusam\")\n             .img_size(\"Lorem\")\n             .img_dominant_color(\"sea\")\n             .img_color_type(\"et\")\n             .hq(\"duo\")\n             .hl(\"et\")\n             .high_range(\"eirmod\")\n             .googlehost(\"sanctus\")\n             .gl(\"et\")\n             .filter(\"amet\")\n             .file_type(\"et\")\n             .exclude_terms(\"consetetur\")\n             .exact_terms(\"ut\")\n             .date_restrict(\"ea\")\n             .cx(\"sed\")\n             .cref(\"dolor\")\n             .cr(\"dolor\")\n             .c2coff(\"dolor\")\n             .doit();\n \nmatch result {\n    Result::HttpError(err) => println!(\"HTTPERROR: {:?}\", err),\n    Result::MissingAPIKey => println!(\"Missing API Key\"),\n    Result::MissingToken => println!(\"Missing Token\"),\n    Result::Failure(_) => println!(\"General Failure (Response doesn't print)\"),\n    Result::FieldClash(clashed_field) => println!(\"FIELD CLASH: {:?}\", clashed_field),\n    Result::Success(_) => println!(\"Success (value doesn't print)\"),\n}\n# }\n```\n## Handling Errors\n \nAll errors produced by the system are provided either as [Result](cmn/enum.Result.html) enumeration as return value of \nthe doit() methods, or handed as possibly intermediate results to either the \n[Hub Delegate](cmn/trait.Delegate.html), or the [Authenticator Delegate](../yup-oauth2/trait.AuthenticatorDelegate.html).\n \nWhen delegates handle errors or intermediate values, they may have a chance to instruct the system to retry. This \nmakes the system potentially resilient to all kinds of errors.\n \n## About Customization/Callbacks\n \nYou may alter the way an `doit()` method is called by providing a [delegate](cmn/trait.Delegate.html) to the \n[Method Builder](cmn/trait.MethodBuilder.html) before making the final `doit()` call. \nRespective methods will be called to provide progress information, as well as determine whether the system should \nretry on failure.\n \nThe [delegate trait](cmn/trait.Delegate.html) is default-implemented, allowing you to customize it with minimal effort.\n \n## About Parts\n \nAll structures provided by this library are made to be [enocodable](cmn/trait.RequestValue.html) and \n[decodable](cmn/trait.ResponseResult.html) via json. Optionals are used to indicate that partial requests are responses are valid.\nMost optionals are are considered [Parts](cmn/trait.Part.html) which are identifyable by name, which will be sent to \nthe server to indicate either the set parts of the request or the desired parts in the response.\n \n## About Builder Arguments\n \nUsing [method builders](cmn/trait.MethodBuilder.html), you are able to prepare an action call by repeatedly calling it's methods.\nThese will always take a single argument, for which the following statements are true.\n \n* [PODs][wiki-pod] are handed by copy\n* strings are passed as `&str`\n* [request values](cmn/trait.RequestValue.html) are borrowed\n \nArguments will always be copied or cloned into the builder, to make them independent of their original life times.\n \n[wiki-pod]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_data_structure\n[builder-pattern]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\n[google-go-api]:
