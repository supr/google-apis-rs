For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion. Variants belong to a variant set. Each of the calls on a variant represent a determination of genotype with respect to that variant. For example, a call might assign probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a sample named NA12345. A call belongs to a call set, which contains related calls typically from one sample.   # Activities   This type is used in activities, which are methods you may call on this type or where this type is involved in.
