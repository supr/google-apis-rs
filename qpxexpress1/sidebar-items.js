In the airline industry a fare is a price an airline charges for one-way travel between two points. A fare typically contains a carrier code, two city codes, a price, and a fare basis. (A fare basis is a one-to-eight character alphanumeric code used to identify a fare.)   This type is not used in any activity, and only used as *part* of another schema.  "],["FlightInfo","A flight is a sequence of legs with the same airline carrier and flight number. (A leg is the smallest unit of travel, in the case of a flight a takeoff immediately followed by a landing at two set points on a particular carrier with a particular flight number.) The naive view is that a flight is scheduled travel of an aircraft between two points, with possibly intermediate stops, but carriers will frequently list flights that require a change of aircraft between legs.

A slice represents a traveller's intent, the portion of a low-fare search corresponding to a traveler's request to get between two points. One-way journeys are generally expressed using 1 slice, round-trips using 2. For example, if a traveler specifies the following trip in a user interface: | Origin | Destination | Departure Date | | BOS | LAX | March 10, 2007 | | LAX | SYD | March 17, 2007 | | SYD | BOS | March 22, 2007 | then this is a three slice trip.
