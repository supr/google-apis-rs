To create an enterprise, an admin of the enterprise must first go through a Play for Work sign-up flow. At the end of this the admin will be presented with a token (a short opaque alphanumeric string). They must then present this to the MDM, who then supplies it to the enroll method. Until this is done the MDM will not have any access to the enterprise.   After calling enroll the MDM should call setAccount to specify the service account that will be allowed to act on behalf of the enterprise, which will be required for access to the enterprise's data through this API. Only one call of setAccount is allowed for a given enterprise; the only way to change the account later is to unenroll the enterprise and enroll it again (obtaining a new token).   The MDM can unenroll an enterprise in order to sever the binding between them. Re-enrolling an enterprise is possible, but requires a new token to be retrieved. Enterprises.unenroll requires the MDM's credentials (as enroll does), not the enterprise's. Enterprises.unenroll can only be used for enterprises that were previously enrolled with the enroll call. Any enterprises that were enrolled using the (deprecated) Enterprises.insert call must be unenrolled with Enterprises.delete and can then be re-enrolled using the Enterprises.enroll call.   The ID for an enterprise is an opaque string.

This might be because the app is free or because they have been allocated a license to the app from a group license purchased by the enterprise.   It should always be true that a user has an app installed on one of their devices only if they have an entitlement to it. So if an entitlement is deleted, the app will be uninstalled from all devices. Similarly if the user installs an app (and is permitted to do so), or the MDM triggers an install of the app, an entitlement to that app is automatically created. If this is impossible - e.g. the enterprise has not purchased sufficient licenses - then installation fails.   Note that entitlements are always user specific, not device specific; a user may have an entitlement even though they have not installed the app anywhere. Once they have an entitlement they can install the app on multiple devices.   The API can be used to create an entitlement. If the app is a free app, a group license for that app is created. If it's a paid app, creating the entitlement consumes one license; it remains consumed until the entitlement is removed. Optionally an installation of the app on all the user's managed devices can be triggered at the time the entitlement is created. An entitlement cannot be created for an app if the app requires permissions that the enterprise has not yet accepted.   Entitlements for paid apps that are due to purchases by the user on a non-managed profile will have \"userPurchase\" as entitlement reason; those entitlements cannot be removed via the API.   # Activities   This type is used in activities, which are methods you may call on this type or where this type is involved in.

For paid products, a group license object is only created as part of the first bulk purchase of that product in Google Play done by the enterprise admin.   The API can be used to query group licenses; the available information includes the total number of licenses purchased (for paid products) and the total number of licenses that have been provisioned, i.e. the total number of user entitlements in existence for the product.   Group license objects are never deleted; if e.g. a free app is added to a collection and then removed, the group license will remain, allowing to keep track of any remaining entitlements.

If this fails (e.g. because the app is not free and there is no available license) then the creation of the install fails.   The API can also be used to update an installed app. If the update method is used on an existing install then the app will be updated to the latest available version.   Note that it is not possible to force the installation of a specific version of an app; the version code is read-only.   If a user installs an app themselves (as permitted by the enterprise), then again an install resource and possibly an entitlement resource are automatically created.   The API can also be used to delete an install resource, which triggers the removal of the app from the device.
